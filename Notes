Every element has a method known as the addEventlistener().
An event is an action or occurrence detected by a program, usually triggered by the user (e.g., clicking a button, typing in a text field) or by the system (e.g., page load, timer expiration).

An event listener is a function that waits for a specific event to occur and then executes a predefined response when it does.

Example in JavaScript:
javascript
Copy
Edit
// Event: Clicking a button
document.getElementById("myButton").addEventListener("click", function() {
    alert("Button clicked!");
});
Event: The "click" action on the button.

Event Listener: The function that listens for the click and shows an alert when it happens.

Essentially, the event is what happens, and the event listener is the mechanism that reacts to it. ðŸš€


tonElement = document.querySelector('.js-button');

const eventListener = () => {
	console.log('yebo');
};

buttonElement.addEventListener('click', eventListener);//this acts like using onclick

//You can also add in mutliple event listeners

buttonElement.addEventListener('click', eventListener);

buttonElement.addEventListener('click', () => {
	console.log('hello');
});

buttonElement.removeEventListener('click', eventListener);
